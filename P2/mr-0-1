would 1
find 1
way 1

a 1
an 1
old 1
service 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
a 1
he 1
pushed 1
the 1
it 1
in 1
protest 1
and 1
a 1
gust 1
of 1
dust-filled 1
rushed 1
he 1
in 1
a 1
stairwell 1
that 1
darkness 1
flickered 1
he 1
ascended 1
the 1
walls 1
stories 1
of 1
time 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
he 1
the 1
tangled 1
of 1
and 1
levers 1
in 1
and 1
time 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
saw 1
it 1
a 1
watch 1
suspended 1
in 1
the 1
the 1
great 1
daniel’s 1
the 1
watch 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
forward 1

the 1
ticking 1
of 1

old-fashioned 1
adjusting 1
the 1
the 1
widening 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
daniel 1

daniel 1
frowned 1

hesitated 1
then 1
pointed 1
to 1
the 1
watch 1
in 1
daniel’s 1
hand 1
that 1
watch 1
to 1
time 1

a 1
silent 1
he 1
placed 1
the 1

in 1
a 1
small 1
circular 1
in 1
the 1
mechanism 1

a 1
of 1
through 1
the 1
