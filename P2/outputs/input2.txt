The House at the End of the Road

The house at the end of Willow Lane had always been empty. Or at least, that was what people told themselves. It was a Victorian structure, towering over the cul-de-sac like a silent guardian, its windows dark and its gates rusted shut. Some said it was haunted, others believed it was cursed.

Lena didn’t believe in ghost stories.

She was new in town, having moved with her father after her mother’s passing. Their new home was just across from the house at the end of the road, and from her bedroom window, Lena had a perfect view of it.

It wasn’t until her third night in town that she noticed something strange.

A flicker of light from one of the windows.

At first, she thought it was a reflection, maybe from a passing car. But the street was empty. Then, the light flickered again. A soft, warm glow, like candlelight.

Lena narrowed her eyes. The house was supposed to be abandoned. But something—or someone—was inside.

The next day after school, curiosity gnawed at her. She found herself walking towards the house, her fingers trailing along the rusted iron gate. It creaked as she pushed it open, the hinges protesting against years of disuse.

The garden was overgrown, wild ivy creeping up the walls. The front door was locked, but as she circled the house, she found a side entrance—a small wooden door, slightly ajar.

Heart pounding, she stepped inside.

Dust clung to the air, and the wooden floor groaned under her weight. The house smelled of age, of forgotten time. Old furniture stood untouched, covered in sheets. The walls were lined with faded paintings, their subjects watching her with hollow eyes.

Then, a sound.

A soft shuffle from upstairs.

Lena froze.

She wasn’t alone.

Swallowing her fear, she climbed the staircase, each step creaking beneath her. The corridor stretched ahead, lined with doors. But one, at the very end, was open. And the flickering light she had seen the night before glowed from within.

She stepped inside.

The room was small, with a single wooden desk and a chair facing a massive bookshelf. Candles burned on the table, their wax dripping down like frozen tears.

And sitting at the desk was a boy.

He was around her age, dressed in old-fashioned clothes—a white shirt, dark suspenders. His hair was unkempt, his face pale. He didn’t look up as she entered, his fingers tracing the pages of a yellowed book.

“You’re not supposed to be here,” he said, his voice calm, almost indifferent.

Lena hesitated. “Neither are you.”

The boy finally turned to face her. His eyes—dark, endless—studied her for a moment. “You saw the light.”

Lena nodded. “How long have you been here?”

The boy looked away, as if counting something unseen. “A long time.”

Lena frowned. “Do you live here?”

He let out a small, almost bitter laugh. “In a way.”

A strange feeling settled over her, like the air had shifted, like something was just out of reach.

Then, before she could ask more, he stood. “You should go.”

Lena hesitated. She had a hundred questions, but something in his expression stopped her.

That night, she watched the house from her window again. The candlelight flickered once more.

The next day, she returned. And the day after that.

Over time, she learned the boy’s name—Elias. He never spoke about where he came from, only that he had been in the house “for as long as he could remember.” He never left, never spoke of a family.

But he wasn’t a ghost. At least, Lena didn’t think so.

One evening, as they sat in the candlelit room, she asked, “Do you ever want to leave?”

Elias was silent for a long time. Then, softly, he said, “I don’t think I can.”

Lena frowned. “Why?”

Elias met her eyes. “Because I belong to the house.”

A chill ran down her spine.

“I don’t understand,” she whispered.

Elias sighed. “The house keeps things. People. Memories.” He glanced around, as if the walls themselves were listening. “I walked in a long time ago… and never walked out.”

Lena shook her head. “That’s not possible. You’re here. You’re real.”

Elias gave her a sad smile. “Real… but not free.”

Lena’s mind raced. Could it be true? Could a house keep someone trapped in time?

She reached for his hand. His skin was warm, solid. But as she gripped it, a sudden wave of dizziness hit her.

For a split second, the room around her shifted. The bookshelves faded, the candles dimmed. The walls cracked and crumbled, as if the house was nothing more than a skeleton of something long dead.

And then—she saw it.

Elias, standing at the same desk, but covered in dust. His hair tangled, his clothes faded, his eyes hollow.

It was as if time had swallowed him whole.

She gasped, stumbling backward.

And then—it was gone. The house returned to normal, Elias looking at her with concern.

“What did you see?” he asked.

Lena’s breath came in short gasps. “You,” she whispered. “But… different.”

Elias sighed. “Now you understand.”

Lena stared at him, at the flickering candlelight casting shadows across his face. She had always thought ghosts were cold, untouchable. But Elias wasn’t a ghost.

He was a memory, held in place by something older, something deeper.

And now, she wasn’t sure if she could ever leave, either.

The candlelight flickered once more.

And outside, the house at the end of the road stood silent. Waiting.
